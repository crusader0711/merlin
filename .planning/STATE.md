# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Produce engineering-grade documentation capturing the complete AERIS-10 radar system from first-principles physics through hardware to software, so the team can maintain and improve the radar without tribal knowledge.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Notation & Parameter Standardization

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Notation & Parameter Standardization)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (conventions and symbol table)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Notation | 1/2 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min)
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Strict dependency chain: Notation -> Physics -> Hardware -> Software -> Research (no skipping ahead)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5 and 6 (SW/HW research) can execute in parallel after Phase 4 completes
- [Roadmap]: GUI_V6.py is the canonical software version; V1-V5 explicitly excluded from documentation
- [01-01]: Document-prefix equation numbering (FMCW-N, LFM-N, BF-N) chosen over section-based numbering for cross-document uniqueness
- [01-01]: Plain-text cross-references because GitHub MathJax does not support \ref{}/\eqref{}
- [01-01]: IEEE 686-2024 as notation authority with Skolnik/Richards as secondary references
- [01-01]: Physical constants in symbol table; all system parameter values deferred to parameter_table.md

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Clarify which AERIS-10 variant (Nexus vs Extended) is primary for physics derivations before Phase 2
- Confirm FPGA Vivado implementation reports are accessible for Phase 3 and Phase 5 feasibility assessments
- Identify which CFAR variant is implemented in Verilog before Phase 4 FPGA pipeline documentation
